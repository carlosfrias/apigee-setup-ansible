# Apigee OPDK Ansible Configuration Accelerator

## Introduction
This repository contains a set of Ansible roles and playbooks to manage the installation, configuration and maintenance of Private Cloud across multiple environments regardless of the size of those environments. These playbooks will ensure that Apigee requirements are met regarding the configuration of the operating system, the bootstrap configuration and the installation of components. The operating system prerequisites are managed with the option to defer management of specific items. The bootstrap configuration is managed whether you do an online installation or exercise one of the two offline installation options. Component installation is managed so that all configuration files are generated to the topology indicated and role of the individual node. These playbooks create a central location from where to manage Private Cloud installations.

## Assumptions 
* This repository assumes that no Apigee Operating System requirements have been fulfilled beyond the 
selection of the initial operating system version. 
* A control server is available from which [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) 
scripts can be invoked.
* A control server that can download scripts from [Github](https://github.com).
* We assume that you have an introductory understanding of [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) and 
[Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/docs/).
* Availability of administrative privilege escalation on the control server and the target nodes.

## Usage Overview
The use of this framework is composed of the following steps:

1. [Setup](setup) an Ansible control server and workspace.
1. Configure an initial Planet topology using the [Ansible inventory](README-inventory.md) file(s).
1. Place Apigee license material in `~/.apigee-secure/license.txt`.
1. Update credentials stored `~/.apigee-secure/credentials.yml`.
1. Update common installation attributes like `opdk_version` that is stored in 
`~/.apigee/custom-properties.yml`.
1. export ANSIBLE_CONFIG to use the target `ansible.cfg` file. 
1. Use `ansible-playbook` to complete the target activity.
